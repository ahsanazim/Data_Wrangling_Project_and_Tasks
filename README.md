# Data Wrangling Project & Tasks

My code from the Fall 2018 iteration of *QBS-181 Data Wrangling*.

A summary of each subdirectory and its contents: 

* `project1` - intro to SQL
    * basic SQL operations (e.g. `ALTER`, `UPDATE`, rename, `WHERE` etc.) on a large healthcare data set
* `project2` - more SQL
    * more in-depth SQL operations such as `GROUP BY`, and `JOIN`s of various kinds
* `project3` - R
    * `tidyr` and `dplyr` packages for general data manipulation
    * `lubridate` for date parsing
    * `rvest` for web scraping
    * and many native R commands for handling data
* `midterm_project` - R + SQL on a public data set
    * an open ended data cleaning assignment focusing on a publicly available data set
    * use `R markdown` for a write-up explaining our process step by step
* `final_project` - R & SQL in review
    * apply most of the skills explored in the course on specific problems designed to test conceptual understanding
    * again centred on big data
